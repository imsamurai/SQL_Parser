Add your SQL statements in *.sql

Run generate_testcases.sh.  This creates the PHPUnit testcases from the SQL, 
using the present output of the parser as its idea of how things should be.

Edit foo.php if necessary to tweak the test to what should actually happen.

To run the tests, from the base directory, do `php tests/test_parser.php`.
